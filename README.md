# LR_Stefan
A CPU time comparison for linearised and regularised solvers with Newton in the case of stochastic Stefan problem

This repository contains the MLP1 Matlab implementations of numerical schemes for the deterministic and stochastic Stefan problem using Newton, Linearised and Regularised solvers. 

The solvers for deterministic case can be access from the folder "LR_solvers" while the CPU time comparison can be performed via "LR_CPU_comparison".

The repository "https://github.com/jdroniou/matlab-PME.git" is used as a basic resource to build this code. The development of the codes here is a joint effort between Muhammad Awais Khan, Jerome Droniou, Kim Ngan Le and Sorin Pop.

The schemes presented here are analysed in the article "Efficient iterative linearised solvers for numerical approximations of stochastic Stefan problems". M. A. Khan, J. Droniou, , K.-N. Le and Sorin Pop.

If you use these codes in a publication, please mention this article.

Note: Other meshes that can be used to run these matlab codes are available in the HHO-Lapl-OM repository, see https://github.com/jdroniou/HHO-Lapl-OM.
